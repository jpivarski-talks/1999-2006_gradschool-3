I'm going to print out this and the previous e-mail. It is what I have
to say for the meeting tomorrow.

I have found the ("ungainly") expression offered in Jackson & Sharre
1975 to approximate the high-energy tail, and have saved plots both as
eps and as gif. They can be found at:
   /home/mccann/scan_strategy/prep_web/Y3s1stScan.{eps,gif}
   /home/mccann/scan_strategy/prep_web/Y3s1stScan_diff.{eps,gif}
   /home/mccann/scan_strategy/prep_web/how_far_for_scan.{eps,gif}

The fit parameters to this fit are:
         CENTER OF MASS             	    BEAM ENERGY
   norm = 0.0784 +/- 0.0020 GeV nb   norm = 0.03918 +/- 0.00098 GeV nb
   mean = 10.35866 +/- 0.00014 GeV   mean = 5.179329 +/- 0.000071 GeV
   sigma = 0.00466 +/- 0.00012 GeV   sigma = 0.002332 +/- 0.000060 GeV
   back = 1.0722 +/- 0.0076          back = 1.0722 +/- 0.0076

Using this function, rather than a Gaussian has shifted the peak by
0.10 MeV (this is within uncertainty) and the sigma here is the same
as the sigmaLeft in the bifurcated Gaussian fit.

The big difference is the area (which I have some reason to believe is
the same as "norm"). When only the peak is fit and integrated, the
area is 22 MeV nb; when the tail is fit and integrated, the area is
39 MeV nb. This is a very long tail--- most of my time was spent having
difficulty with convergence and stability of numerical integrations.

I've also worked out the data necessary to identify an energy shift of
0.2 MeV by repeating a point during a scan. Seeing that one fill of
data gives about 0.1 nb of uncertainty,

     number       /    sqrt(2) 0.1  nsig      \ 2
       of    ==  (  -------------------------  )
     fills        \   0.8643  shiftsize(MeV)  /

This is the number of fills necessary for each of two datapoints (at
the beginning and end of the scan) taken at what is supposed to be the
same energy. "nsig" is the number of standard deviations we can afford
and "shiftsize" is the size of the shift we want to be able to
resolve. To see a 0.2 MeV shift separated by one sigma, we'll only
need 70% of a fill for each of the two data points. For a two sigma
separation, we'll need two long (1.3 X) or three short (0.9 X) fills
for each of the two points.

For a tail measurement, assuming the same uncertainty of 0.1 nb, we
can take one-fill datapoints up to 25 MeV above the peak in beam
energy (up to 5.205 GeV) before the tail gets lost in the noise (to
one sigma). This should be done once to check the line shape, but the
curve that I am using doesn't parameterize the tail separately. In
theory, fitting the peak will constrain the tail, but I don't yet know
how well it will be constrained because I haven't yet integrated the
line shape properly.
