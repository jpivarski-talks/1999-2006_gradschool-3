This is the README file for FitterDiagnosticsProc. It shows you how to write
a Processor in the new CLEO3 Suez environment.

1.) You should only need to edit the FitterDiagnosticsProc.cc file (and
    potentially also FitterDiagnosticsProc.h). Fill FitterDiagnosticsProc.cc with your
    analysis code.

2.) Make a shared library: "gmake shared_module CXX=cxx or g++"
This step requires that you have a standard type of build area,
consisting of (../bin, ../lib, and ../shlib) directories.
The shared processor library will end up in ../shlib!

3.) Set the environment variable C3_SHLIB to include the ../shlib
directory above: setenv C3_SHLIB /home/mkl/build/shlib

4.) Start up Suez: (on lns111) suez

5.) Here is a sample job:

suez> file in test.rp
suez> proc ls

Listing all available Processors:

in memory:

and on disk:
/home/mkl/build/shlib/ FitterDiagnosticsProc

suez> proc sel FitterDiagnosticsProc
suez> go 1
... 
suez> exit
