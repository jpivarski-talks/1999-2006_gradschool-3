Glaciers and Sea Ice Endangered by Rising Temperatures

Janet Larsen

By 2020, the snows of Kilimanjaro may exist only in old photographs. The glaciers in Montana's Glacier National Park could disappear by 2030. And by mid-century, the Arctic Sea may be completely ice-free during summertime. As the earth's temperature has risen in recent decades, the earth's ice cover has begun to melt. And that melting is accelerating.

In both 2002 and 2003, the Northern Hemisphere registered record-low sea ice cover. New satellite data show the Arctic region warming more during the 1990s than during the 1980s, with Arctic Sea ice now melting by up to 15 percent per decade. The long-sought Northwest Passage, a dream of early explorers, could become our nightmare. The loss of Arctic Sea ice could alter ocean circulation patterns and trigger changes in global climate patterns.

On the opposite end of the globe, Southern Ocean sea ice floating near Antarctica has shrunk by some 20 percent since 1950. This unprecedented melting of sea ice corroborates records showing that the regional air temperature has increased by 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1950.

Antarctic ice shelves that existed for thousands of years are crumbling. One of the world's largest icebergs, named B-15, that measured near 10,000 square kilometers (4,000 square miles) or half the size of New Jersey, calved off the Ross Ice Shelf in March 2000. In May 2002, the shelf lost another section measuring 31 kilometers (19 miles) wide and 200 kilometers (124 miles) long.

Elsewhere on Antarctica, the Larsen Ice Shelf has largely disintegrated within the last decade, shrinking to 40 percent of its previously stable size. Following the break-off of the Larsen A section in 1995 and the collapse of Larsen B in early 2002, melting of the nearby land-based glaciers that the ice shelves once supported has more than doubled.

Unlike the melting of sea ice or the floating ice shelves along coasts, the melting of ice on land raises sea level. Recent studies showing the worldwide acceleration of glacier melting indicate that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's estimate for sea level rise this century%Gâ€”%@ranging from 0.1 meters to 0.9 meters%Gâ€”%@will need to be revised upwards. (See table of selected examples of ice melt from around the world.)

On Greenland, an ice-covered island three times the size of Texas, once-stable glaciers are now melting at a quickening rate. The Jakobshavn Glacier on the island's southwest coast, which is one of the major drainage outlets from the interior ice sheet, is now thinning four times faster than during most of the twentieth century. Each year Greenland loses some 51 cubic kilometers of ice, enough to annually raise sea level 0.13 millimeters. Were Greenland's entire ice sheet to melt, global sea level could rise by a startling 7 meters (23 feet), inundating most of the world's coastal cities.

The Himalayas contain the world's third largest ice mass after Antarctica and Greenland. Most Himalayan glaciers have been thinning and retreating over the past 30 years, with losses accelerating to alarming levels in the past decade. On Mount Everest, the glacier that ended at the historic base camp of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the first humans to reach the summit, has retreated 5 kilometers (3 miles) since their 1953 ascent. Glaciers in Bhutan are retreating at an average rate of 30%Gâ€”%@40 meters a year. A similar situation is found in Nepal.

As the glaciers melt they are rapidly filling glacial lakes, creating a flood risk. An international team of scientists has warned that with current melt rates, at least 44 glacial lakes in the Himalayas could burst their banks in as little as five years.

Glaciers themselves store vast quantities of water. More than half of the world's population relies on water that originates in mountains, coming from rainfall runoff or ice melt. In some areas glaciers help sustain a constant water supply; in others, meltwater from glaciers is a primary water source during the dry season. In the short term, accelerated melting means that more water feeds rivers. Yet as glaciers disappear, dry season river flow declines.

The Himalayan glaciers feed the seven major rivers of Asia%Gâ€”%@the Ganges, Indus, Brahmaputra, Salween, Mekong, Yangtze, and Huang He (Yellow)%Gâ€”%@and thus contribute to the year-round water supply of a vast population. In India alone, some 500 million people, including those in New Delhi and Calcutta, depend on glacier meltwater that feeds into the Ganges River system. Glaciers in Central Asia's Tien Shan Mountains have shrunk by nearly 30 percent between 1955 and 1990. In arid western China, shrinking glaciers account for at least 10 percent of freshwater supplies.

The largest aggregation of tropical glaciers is in the northern Andes. The retreat of the Qori Kalis Glacier on the west side of the Quelccaya Ice Cap that stretches across Peru has accelerated to 155 meters a year between 1998 and 2000%Gâ€”%@three times faster than during the previous three-year period. The entire ice cap could vanish over the next two decades.

The Antizana Glacier, which provides Quito, Ecuador, with almost half its water, has retreated more than 90 meters over the last eight years. The Chacaltaya Glacier near La Paz, Bolivia, melted to 7 percent of its 1940s volume by 1998. It could disappear entirely by the end of this decade, depriving the 1.5 million people in La Paz and the nearby city of Alto of an important source of water and power.

Africa's glaciers are also disappearing. Across the continent, mountain glaciers have shrunk to one third their size over the twentieth century. On Kenya's Kilimanjaro, ice cover has shrunk by more than 33 percent since 1989. By 2020 it could be completely gone.

In Western Europe, glacial area has shrunk by up to 40 percent and glacial volume by more than half since 1850. If temperatures continue to rise at recent rates, major sections of glaciers covering the Alps and the French and Spanish Pyrenees could be gone in the next few decades. During the record-high temperature summer of 2003, some Swiss glaciers retreated by an unprecedented 150 meters. The United Nations Environment Programme is warning that for this region long associated with ice and snow, warming temperatures signify the demise of a popular ski industry, not to mention a cultural identity.

Boundaries around Banff, Yoho, and Jasper National Parks in the Canadian Rockies cannot stop the melting of the glaciers there. Glacier National Park in Montana has lost over two thirds of its glaciers since 1850. If temperatures continue to rise, it may lose the remainder by 2030.

In just the past 30 years, the average temperature in Alaska climbed more than 3 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit)%Gâ€”%@easily four times the global increase. Glaciers in all of Alaska's 11 glaciated mountain ranges are shrinking. Since the mid-1990s, Alaskan glaciers have been thinning by 1.8 meters a year, more than three times as fast as during the preceding 40 years.

The global average temperature has climbed by 0.6 degrees Celsius (1 degree Fahrenheit) in the past 25 years. Over this time period, melting of sea ice and mountain glaciers has increased dramatically. During this century, global temperature may rise between 1.4 and 5.8 degrees Celsius, and melting will accelerate further. Just how much will depend in part on the energy policy choices made today.

Palaeoanthropology: Hominid revelations from Chad

The story of human origins in Africa takes a twist with the description of a 6%Gâ€“%@7-million-year-old cranium from Chad. The discovery hints at the likely diversity of early hominids.

A single fossil can fundamentally change the way we reconstruct the tree of life. More than 75 years ago, Raymond Dart's description1 of the Taung skull from southern Africa wrought such a transformation with regard to human evolution. Dart provided hard evidence to support Darwin's prediction that the roots of human evolutionary history run deepest in Africa.

A fossil cranium (Fig. 1), discovered by Michel Brunet and his colleagues and described in this issue, marks a similar turning point in our understanding of human origins. Discussion of the cranium and associated fossils is on page 145 (Brunet et al.2), with presentation of the contextual evidence (Vignaud et al.3) on page 152. The fossils %Gâ€”%@ the cranium, a jaw fragment and several teeth %Gâ€”%@ belong to a primitive human precursor, or hominid, that is an astonishing 6%Gâ€“%@7 million years old. The transformation wrought here is more nuanced than Dart's, but it is as fundamental. Here we have compelling evidence that our own origins are as complex and as difficult to trace as those of any other group of organisms.

For almost 150 years4 it has been suggested that modern humans are more closely related to the African apes than they are to the orang-utan. Nowadays, evidence from both bones and teeth5-7, and soft tissues (muscles, nerves, and so on)8, and from molecular and DNA analyses9, 10, support the view that modern humans and chimpanzees are particularly closely linked. When the DNA differences are calibrated by using palaeontological evidence, they indicate that the hypothetical ancestor of modern humans and the chimpanzee lived between about 5 and 7 million years ago.

The hominid fossil record outside Africa has stubbornly failed to break the 2-million-year barrier. Thus, if the 'molecular clock' keeps reasonably good time, between 3 and 5 million years or so of our independent evolution took place on the African continent. Four regional 'windows' provide fossil evidence relevant to our early evolutionary history. The southern African window was revealed by Dart in 1925 when the first (and only) hominid fossil from Taung, near Kimberley, was recognized; since then, neighbouring cave sites have provided a rich fossil record that stretches back to around 3%Gâ€“%@3.5 million years ago11. The East African window comprises sites along the Eastern, or Gregory, Rift Valley, from close to the Gulf of Aden in the north to northern Tanzania in the south. The sites are associated with sedimentary basins or the rivers that fed or drained them. Two of them, Middle Awash in Ethiopia12, 13 and Lukeino in Kenya14, have so far provided the oldest evidence of creatures that are plausible human ancestors.

The two remaining regions, Malawi and Chad, were, until now, more like spy-holes than windows. Malawi has provided evidence of one of the large-toothed hominid species, probably Paranthropus aethiopicus (see Fig. 2). The first 'early hominid' from Chad, Tchadanthropus uxoris, found in 1961, turned out to be the face of a modern human skull that had been so eroded by wind-blown sand that it mimicked the appearance of an australopith, a primitive type of hominid. The second Chad hominid, Australopithecus bahrelghazali, discovered15 at a site called Koro Toro in 1995, is an authentic australopith and alerted palaeontologists to the potential of central West Africa.

Four areas in and around the Chad basin have yielded mammalian fossils, but it is one locality, TM 266, in the oldest of these areas %Gâ€”%@ Toros-Menalla in the Djurab Desert %Gâ€”%@ that provided Brunet's team with the fossils they describe in this issue. The discovery is a tribute to the tenacity of Brunet, Vignaud and their scientific colleagues, and to their intrepid local field team. The sand-laden wind blows incessantly and the fossil layers are difficult to detect: they are at most a few metres thick and a far cry from the banks of sediment that we are used to seeing in pictures of Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, and the like. Yet, despite the harsh present-day environment, the vertebrate fossils are well preserved, and the hominid cranium (designated TM 266-01-060-1) is remarkably complete.

Absolute %Gâ€”%@ isotope-based %Gâ€”%@ dating methods cannot be applied to the fossil layers at Toros-Menalla because there are no ash layers to provide the necessary argon and potassium. Nor are the sediments suitable for magnetism-based dating methods. Instead, the team matched the rich vertebrate fossil record at TM 266, consisting of examples of 44 different groups, with the equivalent record from sites in East Africa that have absolute dates. The best matches are with two sites in Kenya: the Lukeino Formation of the Tugen Hills (which dates to about 6 million years ago) and the Nawata Formation at Lothagam (5.3%Gâ€“%@7.4 million years). The upshot is a reliable age estimate of about 6%Gâ€“%@7 million years for the Toros-Menalla fossils.

The researchers compared their new evidence with what has been published about two other claimants for the title of 'earliest hominid', Ardipithecus ramidus from the Middle Awash12, 13 and Orrorin tugenensis from Lukeino14. They satisfied themselves (and others, myself included) that the teeth of the new fossils are taxonomically distinctive, and accordingly assigned the fossils to a new species and genus, Sahelanthropus tchadensis.

What was the role of S. tchadensis in the evolution of chimpanzees and modern humans? The latter two look very different, but the differences between the earliest ancestors of chimpanzees and modern humans are likely to have been more subtle. The conventional presumption is that the human%Gâ€“%@chimp common ancestor, and the earliest members of the chimp lineage, or clade, would have been adapted for life in the trees, with the trunk held either horizontal or upright and with the forelimbs adapted for knuckle-walking on large branches or on the ground. This would have been combined with projecting faces that accommodated elongated jaws bearing relatively small chewing teeth and, in males, large upper canine teeth that would have worn against the lower premolars.

Early hominids at the base of our own clade, in contrast, would have been distinguished by at least some skeletal and other adaptations for an upright posture and bipedal walking and running, linked with a chewing apparatus that combined proportionally larger chewing teeth, modest-sized male canines that wore only at the tip of the crown, and some evidence of an increase in brain size. Against these criteria it is the face, jaw and canines of S. tchadensis that point to its being a hominid, at (or at least close to) the base of the modern human clade.

There are two current hypotheses about human origins and the early stages of hominid evolution. According to the linear, or 'tidy', model16, the distinctive hominid anatomy evolved only once, and was followed by a ladder-like ancestor%Gâ€“%@descendant series. In this model there is no branching (cladogenesis) until well after 3 million years ago. The bushy, or 'untidy', model sees hominid evolution as a series of successive adaptive radiations %Gâ€”%@ evolutionary diversification in response to new or changed circumstances %Gâ€”%@ in which anatomical features are 'mixed and matched' in ways that we are only beginning to comprehend17, 18. This model, to which I subscribe, predicts that because of the independent acquisition of similar shared characters (homoplasy), key hominid adaptations such as bipedalism, manual dexterity and a large brain are likely to have evolved more than once19. So the evidence of one, or even a few, of the presumed distinguishing features of hominids might not be enough to link a new species with later hominids, let alone to identify it as the direct ancestor of modern humans.

What is remarkable about the chimp-sized cranium TM 266-01-060-1 discovered by Brunet et al. is its mosaic nature. Put simply, from the back it looks like a chimpanzee, whereas from the front it could pass for a 1.75-million-year-old advanced australopith. The hominid features involve the structure of the face, and the small, apically worn, canine crowns. Other hominid features are found in the base of the cranium and in the separate jaw fragment. If we accept these as sufficient evidence to classify S. tchadensis as a hominid at the base, or stem, of the modern human clade, then it plays havoc with the tidy model of human origins. Quite simply, a hominid of this age should only just be beginning to show signs of being a hominid. It certainly should not have the face of a hominid less than one-third of its geological age. Also, if it is accepted as a stem hominid, under the tidy model the principle of parsimony dictates that all creatures with more primitive faces (and that is a very long list) would, perforce, have to be excluded from the ancestry of modern humans.

In contrast, the untidy model would predict that at 6%Gâ€“%@7 million years ago we are likely to find evidence of creatures with hitherto unknown combinations of hominid, chimp and even novel features. Moreover, because it acknowledges substantial amounts of homoplasy, the model would further predict that certain structures %Gâ€”%@ such as substantial brow ridges (which S. tchadensis has, as is evident in Fig. 1) %Gâ€”%@ are likely to be unreliable for reconstructing relationships because creatures can share features such as brow ridges without necessarily inheriting them from a common ancestor20. S. tchadensis is a candidate for the stem hominid, but in my view it will be impossible to prove that it is.

My prediction is that S. tchadensis is just the tip of an iceberg of taxonomic diversity during hominid evolution 5%Gâ€“%@7 million years ago. Its potentially close relationship with our own, hominid, twig of the tree of life is surely important. More notably, however, I think it will prove to be telling evidence of the adaptive radiation of fossil ape-like creatures that included the common ancestor of modern humans and chimpanzees. The fauna of the Burgess Shale in Canada, which samples a bewildering array of invertebrate groups some 500 million years ago, is a famous example of diversity at the base of an adaptive radiation. Does S. tchadensis belong to the African-ape equivalent of the Burgess Shale?

When Giants Had Wings and 6 Legs
By HENRY FOUNTAIN

Published: February 3, 2004

There was a time when giants roamed the Earth.

No, not those giants, the dinosaurs that stomped and slogged their way through the Mesozoic Era. These giants crawled and crept, slithered and scurried, burrowed, slinked, skittered and, above all, flitted and fluttered millions of years before the dinosaurs arrived.

They were the giant arthropods of the Carboniferous.

There were extra-large mayflies, supersized scorpions and spiders the size of a healthy spider plant. There was an array of giant flightless insects, and a five-foot-long millipede-like creature, Arthropleura, that resembled a tire tread rolled out flat.

But perhaps the most remarkable of all were the giant dragonflies, Meganeuropsis permiana and its cousins, with wingspans that reached two and a half feet. They were the largest insects that ever lived.

These large species thrived about 300 million years ago, when much of the land was lush and tropical and there was an explosion of vascular plants (which later formed coal, which is why the period is called the Carboniferous). But the giant species were gone by the middle to late Permian, some 50 million years later.

Scientists have long suspected that atmospheric oxygen played a central role in both the rise and fall of these organisms. Recent research on the ancient climate by Dr. Robert A. Berner, a Yale geologist, and others reinforces the idea of a rise in oxygen concentration %Gâ€”%@ to about 35 percent, compared with 21 percent now %Gâ€”%@ during the Carboniferous. Because of the way many arthropods get their oxygen, directly through tiny air tubes that branch through their tissues rather than indirectly through blood, higher levels of the gas might have allowed bigger bugs to evolve.

But there are other possibilities %Gâ€”%@ a lack of predators, for example. Fundamentally, no one is certain why there were giants.

"It's been out there in the literature for a long time without a causal mechanism," said Dr. Robert Dudley, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley who has studied the effects of elevated oxygen pressures on modern insects. "This is a very imperfect science. There's a very fragmented paleontological record."

Dr. Jon F. Harrison, a professor at Arizona State who has performed similar studies, said, "It's still in the realm of speculation."

While there has been much interesting research, he added, "it doesn't prove anything yet."

Some scientists argue that these large species may have been nothing out of the ordinary, that, in effect, they may not have been giants at all.

Dr. David Grimaldi, a curator in the division of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History and co-author of a forthcoming book on the evolution of insects, noted that most Carboniferous insects were of very similar size to those found today. But the fossil record tends to be biased toward larger specimens for the simple reason that they are easier to find.

Though about a million insect species now exist, Dr. Grimaldi added, over about 75 million years of the Carboniferous, as species came and went, there were bound to be many more. So the largest species may simply represent the upper range of a far more diverse population.

"If you increase the sampling over millions of years, to some extent you are bound to encounter some giants," Dr. Grimaldi said.

Still, the idea that there were bugs larger than anything to be found today captures the imagination, particularly the idea of a dragonfly with wings as wide as some hawks' (though much less substantial), plucking smaller prey out of the air as modern dragonflies do.

For a long time, scientists believed that an insect of that size must have been able only to glide, but most now believe that the giant dragonflies actually flew.

"It's pretty obvious that they were active fliers," said Dr. Roy J. Beckemeyer, a retired aeronautical engineer in Wichita, Kan., who has studied modern and fossil dragonflies for a decade. Dr. Beckemeyer says he is fortunate to live where he does because many of the best fossil insect specimens come from deposits along ancient bays in what are now Kansas and Oklahoma.

One of his specialties in aeronautics was wing flutter, the relationship between bending and twisting that in the worst of circumstances can cause an airplane's wings to fall off. Modern dragonflies, he said, bend and twist their wings, giving them both loft and propulsion.

There are similarities in the corrugated structure of ancient and modern dragonfly wings, Dr. Beckemeyer said, though in modern species the twisting occurs in the outer half of the wing. "In ancient dragonflies, it appears there was a more gradual twisting over the whole length," he said. "It's likely that they didn't fly as fast."

Even slow flight for an insect that big, however, requires much muscular activity, which creates heat. Dr. Michael L. May, an entomologist at Rutgers, was the first to show that the ancient dragonflies must have had some way to dissipate the extra heat. "If they didn't, they would have cooked themselves," Dr. May said.

Modern dragonflies, like other insects, pump a fluid called hemolymph throughout their bodies. When they get too hot, they can increase the flow of hemolymph to the abdomen, taking the heat away from the tissues in much the same way a car's cooling system carries heat from the engine. The abdomen, which is long and skinny, can dissipate the extra heat through convection.

Although there is no direct evidence, Dr. May said it was possible that ancient dragonflies had a similar system, enabling them to fly for longer periods without overheating.

The lack of evidence %Gâ€”%@ with fossils, generally only the skeletal tissues are preserved %Gâ€”%@ presents problems in figuring out just how these large species were able to exist. But more certainty surrounds the way the oxygen content of the prehistoric atmosphere changed over millions of years.

One way Dr. Berner and his colleagues study oxygen levels is by looking at a different element, carbon, in ancient sedimentary rocks.

"The guiding light in all this is the burial of carbon," Dr. Berner said.

Photosynthesis takes carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and converts it to oxygen, which is released, and organic matter, which is incorporated in the plant. Plants die and decay and are buried, Dr. Berner said, "and for every carbon you bury, you leave an oxygen behind."

So during the Carboniferous, as plants spread on land, there was less carbon dioxide and more oxygen. Dr. Berner calculated that oxygen concentration reached its peak of about 35 percent 300 million years ago. It declined abruptly at the end of the Permian, about 250 million years ago, a time of the greatest mass extinction in the planet's history. (The cause of the decline, and of the extinctions, is a subject of much debate.)

To determine whether all that extra oxygen could have led to giant dragonflies and the like, Dr. Harrison, Dr. Dudley and others turn to modern insects.

Insects "breathe" through holes in their bodies, called spiracles, which are attached to hollow tubes, or tracheas. The tracheas branch into smaller and smaller tubes, and the oxygen diffuses through them, nourishing the extreme reaches of the insect's body.

At current oxygen levels, there is an overall length limit of these tracheal tubes; beyond that, the oxygen level is inadequate. This effectively limits insect size.

One approach, Dr. Harrison said, involves determining whether it is harder for larger insects to get oxygen. If this is true, he added, higher oxygen levels are a benefit to them, and it can be argued that larger insects have had an evolutionary advantage in a high-oxygen atmosphere.

But Dr. Harrison said most of his experiments with grasshoppers and dragonflies do not really support the idea that raising the oxygen level makes a difference. "You've got all the oxygen you need already," he said.

For one thing, he noted, larger insects do not breathe through passive diffusion only. There is some pumping that creates pressure differentials that cause air to actually flow through the tubes, reaching farther than by diffusion alone.

Other research, however, has shown that there is some effect of greater oxygen concentration on the size of an organism. Studies of marine invertebrates, for example, have found a correlation between larger species and colder, more oxygen-rich waters: the more oxygen in the water, essentially, the bigger the creatures get.

Dr. Dudley and others have conducted experiments raising fruit flies and other insects in oxygen-rich environments. Some have shown size increases; others have not.

Dr. Dudley has focused on pressure because, in addition to having a higher concentration of oxygen, the Carboniferous atmosphere would have had much more of the gas. "Plants were pumping oxygen into the atmosphere," he said. The amount of nitrogen would have been undiminished, so overall pressure would have risen.

Though the results have yet to be published, his experiments with fruit flies raised under elevated pressures show a 20 percent increase in body mass over five generations.

But why would more oxygen make for bigger insects?

One idea, Dr. Harrison said, is that oxygen may be a trigger for molting. Before they shed their skin, Dr. Harrison said, invertebrates generally double their weight. During this period, their spiracles and tracheas are of pre-molting size, but they could use much more oxygen to grow. So the ancient atmosphere would have provided more oxygen during molting, enabling greater growth. "That might be a mechanism that would explain this," he said.

Or it may not. For so much remains unknown about these giants. There may be plenty to suggest that oxygen played a role in their evolution, Dr. Dudley said, "but it's real difficult to take it one step further."
