German Court Convicts Internet Cannibal of Manslaughter
By MARK LANDLER

FRANKFURT, Jan. 30 %Gâ€”%@ A German computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he found through the Internet was convicted of manslaughter on Friday, in a ruling that reflected the legal ambiguities of a case that has, by turns, fascinated and repulsed people here.

A court in Kassel, about 90 miles north of here, sentenced the man, Armin Meiwes, to eight-and-a-half years in prison for killing Bernd-Jürgen Brandes, who responded to an Internet posting by Mr. Meiwes seeking someone willing to be "slaughtered." The three-judge court rejected the prosecution's plea for a murder conviction and a life sentence.

"Both were looking for the ultimate kick," said the chief judge, Volker Mütze, after reading the verdict. "This was an act between two extremely disturbed people who both wanted something from each other."

The conviction on a lesser charge means that Mr. Meiwes could be released in less than five years.

Harald Ermel, a lawyer for Mr. Meiwes, said he would appeal the verdict. Mr. Ermel had argued that his client was only guilty of "killing on request," an illegal form of euthanasia that carries a maximum jail term of five years.

"He's a model prisoner," Mr. Ermel told reporters at the courthouse. "He will voluntarily undergo psychiatric therapy to get away from his fetish for men's flesh. I'm sure he won't do anything like this again."

That is not likely to calm the nerves of people in Rotenburg an der Fulda, the secluded village south of Kassel where Mr. Meiwes, 42, lived in a rambling half-timbered house. He played host there to four other men who responded to his Web posting, before finding the 43-year-old Mr. Brandes in March 2001.

What followed was an evening of sexual role-playing and violence, much of it videotaped by Mr. Meiwes. In the end, he stabbed Mr. Brandes to death with a kitchen knife, hung the corpse on a meat hook, and carved it up, storing pieces of flesh in plastic bags in his freezer.

"With every piece of flesh I ate, I remembered him," Mr. Meiwes said during his trial. "It was like taking communion."

It was hard to reconcile the placid, well-dressed defendant in the courtroom with the grisly testimony. Yet it was the legal dilemma, as much as the lurid details of the case, that consumed the court. Convicting Mr. Meiwes of murder would have been difficult, according to legal experts, because the victim consented, even pleaded, to be killed. But confining Mr. Meiwes to a psychiatric hospital would also have presented problems because a court-appointed psychiatrist testified that he was not suffering from "diminished responsibility" at the time of the killing.

When Doug Reese put up his Web site, he felt he was answering a call. A college wrestling coach with a long involvement in Christian youth ministries, he wanted to spread a Christian message to people who were not getting it.

Instead of working through his Methodist church, he created a site with no overtly religious images or affiliation, and articles about weight lifting, nutrition and profiles of athletes. Only after users click a few links do they start to see biblical passages or the religious testimonials of the athletes.

"I wanted it to look like a sports magazine," said Mr. Reese, who coaches at the University of Minnesota at Morris and hopes to turn his three-year-old site into a full-time ministry. "It's a little covert. I know that religion or Christianity is a turn-off with a great part of the population. I didn't want to shove it in people's faces."

Mr. Reese and his Web site, www.tothenextlevel.org, embody an increasingly popular strategy for evangelism in the Internet age. In the segmented realms of the Web, said Tony Whitaker, editor of a guide for online evangelists, sites that use overtly Christian material will reach only people who are already Christians, while everyone else can click by. Unlike Christian radio or television, the new medium calls not for powerful religious symbolism or rhetoric but for the absence of them, he said.

"You're not trying to trick people," Mr. Whitaker said. "You can't appear to be something you're not. But Christians should legitimately appear to be taking a starting point on a subject that doesn't appear to be religious."

A report released in December by the Pew Internet and American Life Project estimated that by December 2002, 35 million Americans had searched for religious or spiritual information online, compared with 36 million who had downloaded music files. Until recently, if someone typed "god" into a search engine, it retrieved as many sites as typing in "sex," said Quentin J. Schultze, a professor of communications at Calvin College who has written about religion and the Web. "So this has been a deeply evangelistic medium. The influence of religious evangelists has been greatly unreported."

Instead of Scripture, the sites come on with information about beauty, diet, fitness, sex and celebrities. Some also have links for donations or offer books or other products for sale. But the sites are not veiled pitches for money, and the approach has elicited little controversy.

Many sites have no church ties and they represent just a fraction of the religious traffic online. "The most creative ones are started by individuals" rather than churches, said Robby Richardson, director of international Internet ministries for Gospel Communications International, a nonprofit umbrella group of 300 ministries based in Muskegon, Mich., whose www.gospelcom.net reaches about two million visitors a month, according to Nielsen//NetRatings. "We're trying to tell church sites, `Don't forget about evangelism.' "

Some sites direct visitors to churches or study groups; others hope readers will convert on the spot, declaring themselves by clicking a button or a link. Bruce Biesenthal, editor of www.thegoal.com, a sports-oriented site in Seattle, said about 300 people in the last two years had clicked a button to say they were making a "decision for Christ" after reading athletes' testimonials on the site. The articles discuss religious themes only after delivering the sports news, he said.

"The site is for people coming because they want to learn about the athlete or the sport," he said. "It's subversive. We want to use the celebrity of the athletes as a platform."

Even as President Bush, in an apparent nod to conservative Christians in his State of the Union address, urged Americans to "work together to counter the negative influence of the culture," many online evangelists are using the R-rated culture to attract visitors.

Some sites discuss gangsta rap or movies like "American Pie" in relatively neutral language. For example, an article on www.damaris.org, a nondenominational Christian ministry based in England, advises, "Eminem and his rap entourage could be described as radical preachers, speaking frankly about the broken communities they come from."

David Bruce, an evangelical Christian who runs a movie review site called www.hollywoodjesus.com, said he liked covering racy films, as long as they were popular, because they had the attention of "pre-Christians." Parts of his site refer people to religious groups, and Mr. Bruce, a former pastor, said he has continuing telephone or e-mail conversations with 100 users at any time.

Mr. Bruce distinguished himself from fundamentalists who protest or boycott the Harry Potter books and movies as occultist.

"I would say I'm part of a new thinking within evangelicals," he said, adding that he receives angry e-mail messages for promoting sexual or violent movies. "I get so tired of Christians that bash Hollywood."

"It isn't content that interests me," he said, continuing that even exploitation movies provide "common ground" for biblical discussion.

"I was so disappointed `Showgirls' wasn't a hit because I would have loved to discuss it," Mr. Bruce said.

Ted Haggard, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, which represents 43,000 congregations, said that the Internet lent itself to all kinds of approaches, both direct and indirect, because different users were ready for different levels of information. A site that did not declare its intentions was the best way to reach some, just as an evangelist in a public square might begin by talking about secular concerns. "You have a moral obligation not to be deceitful," he said. "But you don't have a moral obligation to tell everything you know upfront."

Yet Mr. Haggard worried that on the Internet, anyone could come on as a religious authority %Gâ€”%@ "even a crazy person." He added that because there was so much pornography on the Internet, online evangelism might prove a mixed benefit. "We have more people corrupted on the Internet than we have arrive at the church by the Net," he said.

In Vancouver, British Columbia, Karen Schenk works both direct and indirect approaches to evangelism. She is the director of Web site strategies for TruthMedia, an organization of 20 sites affiliated with Campus Crusade for Christ, an evangelical group. Two sites she oversees are www.womentodayonline.com and www.christianwomentoday.com.

The latter assumes visitors are already involved in churches, she said, and offers articles like "Dive Deeper Into God" and "True Spiritual Change." The former is for women who might not be Christians, and features articles like "I Am Jealous of His Very Attractive Ex-Wife."

It is the secular-looking site that is evangelistic, Mrs. Schenk said. "We're just being sensitive to where people are at and inviting them in. We don't have spinning crosses on Women Today."

To illustrate how beauty tips might be used to spread the gospel, Mrs. Schenk noted that the most popular article on Women Today Online has been an advice column about frizzy hair. Before reading advertisements for L'Oreal, readers see a link that reads, "Are you happy with your body?" If they click on that, they get the life story of a model who battled bulimia but then found success after becoming a born-again Christian. "You can receive Christ right now by faith through prayer," she writes.

Mrs. Schenk said that about 70 percent of the site's traffic was in the secular areas, but that visitors wanting more could receive prayers, Bible passages or Christian mentoring.

The Web site www.mops.org, whose initials stand for Mothers of Preschoolers, offers mothers advice and chat rooms for topics like playdates, money, sexuality and medical needs, and organizes more than 3,000 groups that meet in churches around the country and abroad. The group has 115,000 members, said Karen Parks, the director of ministry networks. Articles are mostly secular, but the site also has areas for religious testimonials and outreach.

The site avoids discussion of political topics or abortion. "We never hide that we're a Christian organization, but we don't want to build any walls or barriers," Ms. Parks said. "We consider a success anything that leads a mom one step closer to Jesus, whatever that step is. Hopefully she goes all the way to meet Jesus, but that might be through another group, and that's fine."

The indirect, or bridge strategy in online evangelizing continues a broader trend among Christian evangelicals, said Randall Balmer, chairman of the religion department at Barnard College and author of "The Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism." In 1975, the Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, Ill., after surveying local residents to see why many did not go to church, dispensed with all Christian iconography, crosses or stained glass windows to appeal to people who were turned off by these. In the 1990's, many evangelical churches dropped the denomination from their names, switching to names like Oak Chapel.

Alan Wolfe, director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College, questioned the long-term value of online religious conversions, no matter how many hits the sites got. He pointed to the Internet outreach in Howard Dean's presidential campaign, which generated furious activity online but so far has not translated into first-place finishes in the primaries. "The Dean camp suggests that meeting through the Internet didn't work," Mr. Wolfe said. "I wonder if a similar Christian strategy is going to work either."


One-Third of Iranian Parliament Quits in Protest
By NAZILA FATHI

Published: February 2, 2004

TEHRAN, Feb. 1 %Gâ€”%@ More than one-third of Iran's Parliament resigned Sunday to protest a sweeping ban on candidates running in the parliamentary election later this month. The defiant move threatened to plunge Iran's political system into chaos.

One by one, angry lawmakers who have held a three-week sit-in at the huge Parliament building, marched up to the podium and handed their resignations to the speaker. In an emotional statement read aloud during the session of Parliament on Sunday and broadcast live across the nation on Iranian radio, the members who resigned accused powerful conservatives of seeking to impose a religious dictatorship like that of the Taliban, who were overthrown by American-led forces in Afghanistan.

"We cannot continue to be present in a Parliament that is not capable of defending the rights of the people and that is unable to prevent elections in which the people cannot choose their representatives," the statement said.

There has been continual tension in Iran between reformers %Gâ€”%@ the president and much of the Parliament %Gâ€”%@ who are pressing for greater religious and cultural freedom, and religious conservatives, who control the judiciary and security services.

Mohammad Reza Khatami, the leader of the main reformist party and the brother of Iran's reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, was among those who resigned. He warned of a conservative coup supported by the military.

The resignations were a move typical of the brinkmanship that marks Iranian politics, to try to get the hard-liners to back down three weeks before a crucial election that will determine the future of the reform movement in Iran.

The student news agency ISNA reported that a pro-democracy Iranian student group said Sunday that it had sought permission to hold public demonstrations on Wednesday to protest the ban, a move that could provoke a clash with riot police officers and vigilante groups.

The mass resignation coincided with what was supposed to be a day of national celebration, the 25th anniversary of the return to Iran of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini from exile in France. The cleric led a popular Islamic revolution that brought an end to the 2,500-year monarchy and ushered in an Islamic Republic.

The resignations came a day after the president announced that his negotiations with senior religious officials had failed to resolve the crisis.

Last month, the hard-line Guardian Council barred more than 2,000 candidates, including 87 current members of Parliament, from competing for the 290-seat assembly in elections scheduled for Feb. 20.

The council ignored an announcement by the Interior Ministry, which is under the president's supervision, that it intended to postpone the election, and even an order by the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to reinstate the candidacies of the current members of Parliament.

The number of members who resigned had reached 123 by Sunday afternoon. The move, which is likely to intensify the fight between reformers and their hard-line opponents, was unprecedented in the country's parliamentary history.

The members who resigned continued their sit-in in the afternoon, calling again for the decision barring the candidacies to be reversed and for the elections to be delayed.

The speaker of Parliament, Mehdi Karoubi, said he and Mr. Khatami had appealed once more to Ayatollah Khamenei to intervene and help end the crisis. Ayatollah Khamenei has the final word on all state matters.

Among those who resigned was the deputy speaker of Parliament, Behzad Nabavi. Several prominent women among the members also resigned. "An election whose result is clear beforehand is treason to the rights and ideals of the nations," said Rajabali Mazroui, another member of the group.

Mr. Khatami, the brother of the president, said the Guardian Council had killed opportunities and left them no other solution.

"Even if all those disqualified are reinstated today, there will be no time for competition," he said. He called the elections "illegitimate" under the present structure of the ruling establishment, and said, "This is the end of the reform movement."

If the hard-liners hold the elections, he added, "it will be a full-fledged coup with the help of military forces and confirmation that it is illegitimate."

Under the law, Parliament must approve the resignations and can reject them if they would deny the body the two-thirds quorum it needs to operate. But those who resigned said they would refuse to take part in the sessions even if their resignations were refused.

Many of the allies of Ayatollah Khomeini during the 1979 revolution are reformist politicians today, and they contend that today's hard-liners have gone against the tenets of Ayatollah Khomeini.

They recall his emphasizing the republican nature of his government and saying that "the criterion is the people's vote."

"From the day we held the referendum in 1979," Ayatollah Khomeini "insisted on an Islamic Republic %Gâ€”%@ not a word less and not a word more, he kept saying, said Mr. Karoubi, the Parliament speaker. "He repeated this until he died."

"Now we see that a couple of old men want to run the country," he added, referring to the council.

The Guardian Council, whose six clerics are handpicked by Ayatollah Khamenei and six Islamic lawyers appointed by the judiciary, took over screening of election candidates after the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989.

"The whole dilemma is because of this contradiction in the Guardian Council's role," said Ibrahim Yazdi, secretary general of the opposition party, the Freedom Movement, who was once a close aide to Ayatollah Khomeini. "The only solution to resolve the matter is for the Guardian Council to return to its former role and just supervise the elections."

The dispute has raised questions about whether the revolution has moved toward its goals and democracy 25 years later.

As many as 28 provincial governors threatened to resign, and a dozen cabinet ministers said they were determined to quit if the Guardian Council did not back off from its decision, which they called undemocratic.

President Khatami hinted Saturday that his government would call off the vote if it could not hold elections that were both competitive and free.
