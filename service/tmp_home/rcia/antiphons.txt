O Wisdom of God,
   which art the Word proceeding from the Most High;
   reaching from the beginning to the end;
   firmly and gently disposing all things:
Come Thou, and teach us in the way of understanding.
Come, Lord Jesu.

O Adonai,
   Captain of the House of Israel;
   Thou which didst appear unto Moses in the fire of the burning bush,
   and gavest unto him the law in Sinai:
Come Thou, and redeem us with Thine outstretched arm.
Come, Lord Jesu.

O Root of Jesse,
   which standest for an ensign of the people,
   before Whom Kings shall shut their mouth,
   unto Whom the nations shall make their supplications:
Come Thou, and deliver us; make no longer tarrying.
Come, Lord Jesu.

O Key of David,
   Sceptre of the House of Israel,
   Which openest and no man shutteth;
   Which shuttest and no man openeth:
Come Thou, and bring forth from the prison-house him that is bound.
Come, Lord Jesu.

O Dayspring from on high,
   Brightness of Eternal Light,
   Sun of Righteousness:
Come Thou, and shine upon them that are sitting in darkness and in the
      shadow of death.
Come, Lord Jesu.

O King of the Gentiles,
   God of Israel and his Saviour,
   chief Corner-stone,
   which makest both one:
Come Thou, and save Thy creatures, whom Thou didst fashion from the
      dust of the earth.
Come, Lord Jesu.

O Emmanuel,
   our King and Lawgiver,
   the Expectation of the Gentiles,
   and their Desire:
Come Thou unto our salvation, O Lord our Saviour and our God.
Come, Lord Jesu.

O Shepherd of Israel,
   Lord over the house of David;
   Whose goings forth have been from of old,
   even from everlasting:
Come Thou, and feed Thy people in Thy strength, and rule them in
      equity and judgment.
Come, Lord Jesu.
