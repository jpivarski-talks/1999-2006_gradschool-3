This is the README file for HistogramModule. It shows you how to write
a Module, the basic Suez building block.

1.) Modules come with at least one external command (the command which
is announced to Suez, and by which you can call the module). It may
have more than one external command! And it may have ANY number of
external commands (including none!).

2.) Don't touch "*_DONT_TOUCH.cc"! Else you'll die.

3.) Make a shared library: "gmake shared_module CXX=<compiler>"
This step requires that you have a standard type of build area,
consisting of (../bin, ../lib, and ../shlib) directories.
The shared processor library will end up in ../shlib!

3.) Set the environment variable C3_SHLIB to include the ../shlib
directory above: setenv C3_SHLIB /home/mkl/build/shlib

4.) Start up Suez: (on lns111) suez

5.) Here is a sample job:

suez> module sel HistogramModule
suez> module inter HistogramModule
suez> help
<shows all internal commands>
HistogramModule> exit
suez> help
<shows all external commands including your new external module command>

 That's It! Questions, Suggestions, Complaints --> Martin Lohner
