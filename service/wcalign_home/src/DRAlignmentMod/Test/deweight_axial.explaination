Turning off the axial section of the drift chamber is more complicated
than turning off the ZD--- there's no ChisqFitProd parameter for it,
but you can do it with fittingweights.

The first two lines are familiar to anyone who has used ASCII
constants, the next four are specific to DRWeight2LayerDriftEntAng:
they are the bounds and number of bins in the fittingweight VS drift
and VS entrance angle function.  After that, the real fittingweight
data begins:

    1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 DEFAULT
    1414
    0 1 0 0
    0 15 0 1.5
    0 0 1 -1.
    0 0 2 1.
    1 1 1 1000
    1 1 2 1000
    1 2 1 1000
    1 2 2 1000

The first column is the layer number, the next two are drift and
entang bins, and the last is fittingweight.  This fittingweight is the
uncertainty in drift distance given to a hit in units of 123 microns.
In dewight_axial.drweight2layerdriftentang, I have set the drift
uncertainty of hits in layers 1-16 (the axial section) to 1000, which
is 1.23 meters.

If better fittingweights are available in the future (and there should
be), you can incorporate these weights and deweight the axial section
by downloading an ASCII copy of the new weights, change the first two
numbers to "1 0" (in case they are "0 0" or specify a particular run
range that you might not be using), and then inflate the fourth column
of everything which has a 1-16 in the first column.  The following awk
commandline should work:

awk '($1>=1 && $1<=16 && $9!="DEFAULT"){print $1, $2, $3, 1000} ($1<1 || $1>16 || $9=="DEFAULT"){print $0}' < newly_downloaded_constants.drweight2layerdriftentang > ready_to_deweight_axial.drweight2layerdriftentang

(Note that this won't change the validity range to "1 0".)
