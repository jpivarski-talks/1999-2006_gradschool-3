{\huge \bf How did this happen?}

To work around an artificial limitation in GEANT, the IR geometry
description was replaced by a description of the west side only, then
replicated on the east side by mirror symmetry.

\vspace{0.1cm}
\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{change_IRGeom.eps}\end{center}
\vspace{0.1cm}

Kalman only looked for the first instance of beamwall objects.

\vspace{-0.6cm}

\begin{minipage}{0.65\linewidth}
Before a fit, the error matrix is initialized to
\end{minipage} {\scriptsize $\left(\begin{array}{c c c c c}
.5 \mbox{m}^{-2} & & & & \\
 & .1 & & & \\
 & & .1 \mbox{m}^2& & \\
 & & & 5 & \\
 & & & & 5 \mbox{m}^2 \\
\end{array}\right)$ }. \\

\hspace{0.2cm} \begin{minipage}[b]{7cm}
Kalman's algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}

  \item Find a surface intersection in X-Y.

  \item Check that the track's Z \mbox{intersects} the surface.

  \item If not the first surface, be sure that $x p_x + y p_y$ hasn't
  changed sign.

  \item If not, apply scattering and hit if applicable.

\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.3cm}

\end{minipage}

\vspace{0.5cm}

If the track misses the first surface in Z, Kalman erroneously
compares against the sign of zero, which is unpredictable due to
round-off error.

\vspace{0.5cm}

If $x p_x + y p_y$ at the point of closest approach is $-\epsilon$,
Kalman won't add any hits, leaving the error matrix huge.

\heading{Bug Fixes}
\Large

\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}

\vspace{1cm}

The following bug fixes are part of a patch on {\tt Nov04\_02\_P2}:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf MissingBeamWall:} Kalman's internal representation of
beamwall objects has been extended to 100 meters to ensure that no
track can escape the wall in Z.

\vspace{0.5cm}

This fix removes the condition that allowed BigErrorMatrix to be
frequent.

\vspace{1cm}

\item {\bf BigErrorMatrix:} The check of the sign of $x p_x + y p_y$
is now protected by an additional test that it is sufficiently far
from zero ($10^{-10}$).

\vspace{1cm}

\item The RICH code has been updated to look at other candidates or
  inward fits if an error matrix is unreasonably large.

\end{itemize}

\end{minipage}

\heading{Summary}
\Large

\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}

\begin{itemize}

  \vspace{0.3cm}

  \item Half the tracks in affected datasets do not scatter in the
  beampipe.  This correction is only as large as 0.1\% for tracks
  under 600 MeV.  It changes error matrix elements by as much as
  $1/5^{\mbox{th}}$.

  \vspace{0.3cm}

  \item 10\% of the tracks in affected datasets are not properly
  outward-fit.  They are easily identifiable by
  \begin{center}{\tt
  track\_iterator->exitPionQuality()->numberHits() < 3}.\end{center}
  Nothing is wrong with their inward fits.  They even have normal
  residual distributions.

  \vspace{0.3cm}

  \item RICH failed on $2/3$ of these tracks because of a large error
  matrix.  For these,
  \begin{center}{\tt
  track\_iterator->richInfo()->pionHypWasAnalyzed()}\end{center}
  has been set to {\tt false}.

  \vspace{0.3cm}

  \item Data16, 17, and 11 (and potentially 5 and 6) Monte Carlo
  samples have the bug, while the data does not.

  \vspace{0.3cm}

  \item Data18, 9, 20 and 21 have the bug in data.

  \vspace{0.3cm}

  \item The patch of the {\tt Nov\_04\_02\_P2} code release will not
  have the bug, nor will subsequent datasets.

\end{itemize}
