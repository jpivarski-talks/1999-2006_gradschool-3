These routines have been modified from the originals in the library.

xts_rfv is here because of a integer*8 problem that works for Dan but not for
        me. Don't know what's going on there, but my fixes make it work for me.
        Investigating still...

dvzfbr and dvgrun are here because there's a rogue dvgrun linked statically
       into suez that screws up. This dvgrun is renamed dvgrunadam. dvzfbr is
       here with the altered call to dvgrunadam.
