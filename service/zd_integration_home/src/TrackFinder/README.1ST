This is the TrackFinder library.

It has the routines that call DOIT and C3TR

There are no producers/processors/proxies here. Rather, the library generated
by this directory is used by DoitProcessor, C3TRProcessor, etc.

The Fortran header files in TrackFinder/TrackFinder will eventually be 
generated automatically.
