% Questions, Improvements, Comments to kme and CLEOAC
%
% LATEX 2e Template for CLEO Papers
% YOU MUST USE REVTEX4 and latex 2e
%
% Checklist for Paper Drafts:
% ---------------------------
% 0) Use appropriate \documetclass line as indicated below
% 1) Draft Number: Use latest CBX number, append A for the first vote
%                                (B,C,... for subsequent if any votes)
% 2) Don't use CLNS or CLEO numbers - this happens after your vote.
% 3) Title; use \\ to break title over several lines.
% 4) Abstract
% 5) For the Author list use CLEO Collaboration only
% 6) Body
% 
% Checklist for Journal Submissions:
% ----------------------------------
% 0) Use appropriate \documetclass line as indicated below
%    - For CLNS, hep-ex, preprints, conf. paper use CLNS version
%    - For PRL submission use PRL version
%    - For PRD submission use PRD version 
%      AND use \author{(CLEO Collaboration)} instead of \collaboration{CLEO}
%      SEE PRD_SPECIAL_CHANGEME in author list during step 5 below
% 1) CLEO paper number (from CLEOAC)
% 2) CLNS preprint number (from CLEOAC)
% 3) Title; use \\ to break title over several lines.
% 4) Abstract
% 5) Author list (from CLEOAC)
% 6) PACS codes
% 7) Body
% 8) Add acknowledgments
% 9) Hardcode the \date when ready to submit to journal and hep-ex.
%
% Checklist for Conference Papers:
% --------------------------------
% 0) Use appropriate \documetclass line as indicated below
%    - For conf. paper use CLNS version
% 1) CLEO conference paper number (from CLEOAC) (don't use CLNS)
% 2) Title; use \\ to break title over several lines.
% 3) To \thanks after title, add appropriate conference info.
% 4) Abstract
% 5) Author list (from CLEOAC)
% 6) Body
% 7) Add acknowledgments
% 8) Hardcode the \date when ready to submit to conference and hep-ex.
% 
% KNOWN PROBLEMS with template and REVTEX4
% - can't have \collaboration in PRD style grouped author list
%   Using \author{(CLEO Collaboration)} instead
% - can't make abstract appear before full author list ala CLNS notes
%   Abandoning this as the format for CLNS.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We present recent results from the CLEO experiment.

% Insert body of the text here.
We use the CLEO detector, described more fully in
\cite{Kubota:1992ww,Hill:1998ea}, to study the production and decay of
particles in $e^+e^-$ collisions at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring.
(See Fig.~\ref{fig:cleo}.)
The data are collected at or near the  energies of the $\Upsilon(nS)$
resonances, where $n=1$--$4$, or in the region of the $J/\psi$ and
$\psi(nS)$ resonances, $n=2,3$.
