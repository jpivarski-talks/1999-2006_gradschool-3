\maketitle

The widths of the \ups\ meson, a $b\bar{b}$ bound state discovered in
1977 \cite{discovery}, are related to the quark-antiquark spatial wave
function at the origin \cite{wavefunction}.  Recently, these widths
have been recognized as a testing ground for QCD lattice gauge theory
calculations \cite{lattice}.  Improvements in the lattice
calculations, such as the avoidance of the quenched approximation
\cite{unquenched}, provide an incentive for more accurate experimental
tests.  The di-electron widths, \gee, of the \us, \uss, and \usss\ are
currently measured to 2.2\%, 4.2\%, and 9.4\% \cite{pdg}.  Validation
of these lattice calculations at the few percent level will increase
confidence in similar calculations used to extract important weak
interaction parameters from data.  In particular, \gee\ and $f_D$
\cite{fd} are complimentary tests of the calculation of
$f_B$, which is used to determine the CKM parameter $V_{td}$.

Our measurement of \gee\ follows the method of \cite{pdg}: we
integrate the production cross section of \ups\ over incident \ee\
energies.  Then,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:gee}
\Gamma_{ee} = \frac{{M_\Upsilon}^2}{6\pi^2}\int \sigma(e^+e^- \to
\Upsilon) \, dE \mbox{,}
\end{equation}
ignoring initial state radiation and beam energy spread.  We also
determine the \ups\ full widths using $\Gamma = \Gamma_{ee}/{\mathcal
B}_{ee}$ where ${\mathcal B}_{ee}$ is the $\Upsilon \to e^+e^-$
branching fraction, and assume ${\mathcal B}_{ee}$ = \bmm\ to take
advantage of the well-measured $\Upsilon \to \mu^+\mu^-$ branching
fractions \cite{istvan}.

The Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), a symmetric \ee\ collider,
scanned center-of-mass energies in the vicinity of the \us, \uss, and
\usss\ and the CLEO-III detector collected the \ups\ decay products to
determine the cross section at each energy.  A fit to this resonance
lineshape yields $\int \sigma(e^+e^- \to \Upsilon) \, dE$.  This fit
includes the effects of initial state radiation, beam energy spread,
backgrounds, and interference between \ups\ and continuum final
states.  The eleven \us, six \uss, and seven \usss\ scans have an
integrated luminosity of 0.27, 0.08, and 0.22 fb\inv, with 0.19, 0.41,
and 0.14 fb\inv\ of data below each peak to constrain backgrounds.

The CLEO-III detector is a nearly 4$\pi$ tracking volume surrounded by
a CsI crystal calorimeter \cite{cleoiii}.  Charged tracks are
reconstructed in a 47-layer wire drift chamber and 4-layer silicon
strip detector, and their momenta are inferred from their radii of
curvature in a 1.5 T magnetic field.  The calorimeter forms a
cylindrical barrel around the tracking volume, reaching angles
$\theta$ with respect to the beam axis of $|\cos\theta|$ $<$ 0.85,
with endcaps extending this range to $|\cos\theta|$ $<$ 0.98.
Electron showers have a resolution of 75 MeV at beam energy (5 GeV).

The \ups\ mesons are produced nearly at rest and decay into leptonic
final states $e^+e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, or $\tau^+\tau^-$, or into
approximately ten hadrons through strong decay via $ggg$ or $gg\gamma$
intermediate states, or through electroweak decay via a $q\bar{q}$
intermediate state.  The \uss\ and \usss\ can also make transitions
into other $b\bar{b}$ resonances such as $\chi_{bJ}(nP)$, \us, and
\uss.  The leptonic decays together account for only about 7\% of the
decays of each resonance and are difficult to distinguish from
background, so we select hadrons, fit the hadronic cross section, and
report $\geehadtot$.  We then correct for the missing leptonic modes
to report \gee.

Bhabha scattering ($e^+e^- \to e^+e^-$) is our largest background.  We
suppress these events by requiring the greatest track momentum
($P_{\mbox{\scriptsize max}}$) to be less than 80\% of the beam
energy, shown in Figure \ref{fig:cuts}-a, which reduces the Bhabha
background to approximately the same magnitude as the hadronic
continuum ($e^+e^- \to q\bar{q}$) background.  Continuum annihilation
processes such as these are accounted for by including a $1/s$ term in
the lineshape fit, where $s = {E_{\mbox{\scriptsize CM}}}^2 = (2
E_{\mbox{\scriptsize beam}})^2$.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{cuts}
  \caption{\label{fig:cuts} Two of the distributions used to identify
hadronic \ups\ decays.  Solid histograms are data, dashed are
simulated \ups\ decays, both with all hadronic selection criteria
applied except the one shown.}
\end{figure}

Two-photon fusion events ($e^+e^- \to e^+e^- X$) contribute a
non-$1/s$ background, so we suppress these by requiring the total
visible energy (energy sum of all charged tracks and neutral showers)
to be more than 40\% of the center-of-mass energy, shown in Figure
\ref{fig:cuts}-b.  A small $\log s$ term (8\% of continuum below \us)
and a $1/(\sqrt{s}-M_\Upsilon)$ term for each of the lighter \ups\
resonances (about 0.5\% of continuum) are also added to the fit
function.  Because the off-resonance data points are only 20 MeV below
each resonance, the different functional forms affect the background
estimation at the peak by less than 0.04\%.

Cosmic rays and beam-gas (collisions between a beam electron and a gas
nucleus inside the beampipe) are suppressed by requiring charged
tracks to point toward the collision point.  We reduce this to less
than 1\% of the continuum by demanding that at least one reconstructed
track pass within 5 mm of the beam axis and the vertex reconstructed
from all primary tracks be within 7.5 cm of the collision point along
the beam axis.  We determine and subtract the remaining contamination
at each energy using special single-beam and no-beam data runs
normalized using events with a solitary large impact parameter track
(for cosmic rays) or vertices along the beam axis but far from the
collision point (for beam gas).

Backgrounds are summarized in Figure \ref{fig:backgrounds}.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{backgrounds}
  \caption{\label{fig:backgrounds} The event yield as a function of
center-of-mass energy in the region of the \usss.  The top points are
data, with the fit superimposed, and the dashed curve represents the
sum of all backgrounds.  The lower points and lines show the
individual non-1/s background contributions.}
\end{figure}

While our hadronic selection criteria eliminate essentially all
$\Upsilon \to e^+e^-$ and $\Upsilon \to \mu^+\mu^-$ decays, they
accept 57\% of $\Upsilon \to \tau^+\tau^-$, according to a GEANT-based
Monte Carlo simulation \cite{mc} including final state radiation
\cite{photos}.  We therefore include in the fit function an $\Upsilon
\to \tau^+\tau^-$ background term, including interference with
continuum $e^+e^- \to \tau^+\tau^-$, using the measured ${\mathcal
B}_{\tau\tau}$ \cite{jean}.

A small fraction of hadronic \ups\ decays fail our event selection
criteria.  Instead of estimating this inefficiency with the Monte
Carlo simulation, which would introduce dependence on the decay and
hadronization models, as well as the detector simulation, we use a
data-based approach.  We select $\Upsilon(2S) \to \pi^+\pi^-
\Upsilon(1S)$ to study \us\ decays tagged by \pipi.  If the \pipi\
were sufficient to satisfy the trigger, the efficiency would be the
ratio of \us\ events satisfying our selection criteria (excluding the
\pipi\ tracks and showers) to all \us\ events.

We can apply the above procedure directly using a 1.3 fb\inv\ sample
at the \uss\ peak and a special two-track trigger, but this trigger is
prescaled, so this procedure can only determine the hadronic
efficiency to 3\% of itself.  Therefore, we use the two-track trigger
to determine the efficiency of an unprescaled but more restrictive
hadronic trigger ($\ehtrig$), and then use the full statistics from
the hadronic trigger to determine our selection efficiency, once this
trigger has been satisfied ($\ecuts$).  Our selection efficiency is
then the product of $\ehtrig$ and $\ecuts$.

The mass of the system recoiling against the \pipi\ candidates in the
two-track trigger sample is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cascades}-a and
the subset of events that fail the hadronic trigger is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:cascades}-b.  After correcting for leptonic decays in the
\us\ sample, we find $\ehtrig$ = (99.59 $^{+0.29}_{-0.45}$)\% from the
ratio of fit yields.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{cascades}
  \caption{\label{fig:cascades} Mass of the system recoiling against
the \pipi\ in $\Upsilon(2S) \to \pi^+\pi^- \Upsilon(1S)$ candidates
satisfying the two-track trigger.  The solid curve is a double
Gaussian fit and the dashed curve is a linear background.}
\end{figure}

From $\Upsilon(2S) \to \pi^+\pi^- \Upsilon(1S)$ events that satisfy
the hadronic trigger, we find $\ecuts$ = (98.33 \PM\ 0.33)\%.  This
has been corrected for leptonic decays, the boost of the \us, track
and shower confusion from the \pipi, and the efficiency of the full
set of triggers.  Only the first correction is significant.  Our event
selection and trigger efficiency is therefore (97.93
$^{+0.44}_{-0.56}$)\% for the sum of all non-leptonic \us\ decays.

To find the \uss\ and \usss\ efficiencies, we correct the \us\
efficiency for energy dependence and for transitions specific to these
excited states, using simulations.  Only transitions to lower \ups\
resonances which then decay to \ee\ or \mm\ introduce a significant
correction.  We measure the branching fractions of these
$X\ell^+\ell^-$ decays to be (1.58 \PM\ 0.16)\% and (1.34 \PM\
0.13)\%, respectively, resulting in \uss\ and \usss\ efficiencies of
(96.18 $^{+0.44}_{-0.56}$ \PM\ 0.15)\% and (96.41 $^{+0.44}_{-0.56}$
\PM\ 0.13)\%, where the first uncertainty is common to all three
resonances.

We use Bhabha events to determine the relative luminosity of each scan
point.  We select the Bhabhas by requiring two or more central tracks
with momenta between 50\% and 110\% of the beam energy, and $E/p$
consistent with $e^+$ and $e^-$.  Contamination from $\Upsilon \to
e^+e^-$ is 2--5\% and is readily calculated given \bmm\ once we have
done our \ups\ lineshape fit.  Our subtraction includes
energy-dependent interference between $\Upsilon \to e^+e^-$ and
Bhabhas.

We determine the overall luminosity scale using the method of
\cite{oldlumi} from Bhabhas, $e^+e^- \to \mu^+\mu^-$, and $e^+e^- \to
\gamma\gamma$, with the {\textsc Babayaga} event generator
\cite{babayaga}.  The systematic uncertainties from the three
processes are 1.6\%, 1.6\%, and 1.8\%, respectively, dominated by
track finding and resonance interference for \ee\ and \mm, and by
photon finding and angular resolution for $\gamma\gamma$.  The three
measurements give consistent results off-resonance, where \ups\
contamination is negligible.  We use the weighted mean to determine
the luminosity, and take the RMS scatter of 1.3\% as the systematic
uncertainty.

Bhabha and $\gamma\gamma$ luminosities, normalized to the same value
off-resonance, deviate by (0.8 \PM\ 0.2)\%, (0.3 \PM\ 0.4)\%, and (0.7
\PM\ 0.2)\% at the \us, \uss, and \usss\ peaks.  We correct each \gee\
by half of its discrepancy and take half the discrepancy and its
uncertainty in quadrature as a systematic uncertainty.

Accurate measurement of beam energy is also important for determining
\gee.  An NMR probe calibrates the field of the CESR dipole magnets
and hence provides the beam energy, after corrections for RF frequency
shifts, steering and focusing magnets, and electrostatic
electron-positron separators.  To limit our sensitivity to drifts in
this measurement, we limit scans to 48 hours and alternate
measurements above and below the peak.  By repeating a resonance
cross-section measurement at a point of high slope, we find that beam
energy calibration drifts by less than 0.04 MeV within each scan (68\%
C.L.), which implies a 0.2\% uncertainty in \gee.

The data for each resonance are separately fit to a lineshape function
that consists of a three-fold convolution of (a) a Breit-Wigner
resonance including interference between $\Upsilon \to q\bar{q}$ and
$e^+e^- \to q\bar{q}$, (b) an initial state radiation distribution as
given in Equation 28 of \cite{kf}, and (c) the Gaussian spread in CESR
beam energy, plus the background terms described above.  The radiative
corrections account for emission of real and virtual photons by the
initial \ee.  We do not correct for vacuum polarization, which is
absorbed into the definition of \gee.  The resulting \gee\ values
therefore should represent the Born diagram coupling a pure \ee\ state
to the \ups.  The lineshape fits are insensitive to the Breit-Wigner
widths, which are fixed to the PDG values \cite{pdg}.  The \us\
lineshape is sensitive to the amount of hadronic interference, which
would increase if \ups\ decays via $ggg$ interfered with $q\bar{q}$
decays from the continuum.  Assuming that $\Upsilon \to ggg$ and
$\Upsilon \to q\bar{q}$ processes have no relative phase, the data
disfavor such additional interference.  The value of $\geehadtot$ of
each resonance is allowed to float, as is the continuum normalization,
and, to remove sensitivity to beam energy shifts between scans, the
peak energy of each scan.  In addition, we fit for the beam energy
spread of groups of scans with common CESR horizontal steerings, but
allow shifts when the steerings change, since they can change the beam
energy spread by 1\%.  Uncertainties from radiative corrections,
$\tau^+\tau^-$ normalization, and continuum interference add 0.2\% to
the uncertainty in $\geehadtot$.

The results are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:fits}.  The fit function
describes the data well, though the \us\ and \uss\ have large $\chi^2$
values.  The $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom ($N_{\mbox{\scriptsize
dof}}$) for \us\ is $240/187$ (0.5\% confidence), for \uss\ is
$107/66$ (0.1\% confidence), and for \usss\ is $155/159$ (59\%
confidence).  Pull distributions versus energy and versus date show no
obvious trends, so we take the large $\chi^2$ values as an indication
that point-by-point uncertainties are underestimated, and increase the
statistical uncertainty by $\sqrt{\chi^2/N_{\mbox{\scriptsize dof}}}$
if it is greater than unity.

Our values of $\geehadtot$, listed in Table \ref{tab:results}, are
consistent with, but more precise than, but PDG world averages
\cite{pdg} and our \usss\ measurement is substantially more precise
than the previous one.  To determine \gee\ for each resonance, also
listed in the Table, we assume ${\mathcal B}_{ee} = {\mathcal
B}_{\mu\mu} = {\mathcal B}_{\tau\tau}$ and obtain \bmm\ from
\cite{istvan}.  Also assuming ${\mathcal B}_{ee} = {\mathcal
B}_{\mu\mu}$, we obtain new values of the \ups\ full widths: 54.4 \PM\
0.2 {\it (stat)} \PM\ 0.8 {\it (syst)} \PM\ 1.6 {\it (}\bmm{\it )}
keV, 30.5 \PM\ 0.3 \PM\ 0.5 \PM\ 1.3 keV, and 18.6 \PM\ 0.2 \PM\ 0.3
\PM\ 0.9 keV.
